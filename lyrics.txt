There's something in the air
There's something on the wire
There's something in the way I'm seeing
That keeps me satisfied
You've got it in my head
Stars up, you've got it in my eye
Somehow in the dark
You've found me and brought me to the light
And it feels like love
It feels like love
And it won't be enough
But it feels like
Like you might be the death of me
It's not like me to fall
It's really not my style
It's not like me to be so foolish
I haven't in a while
Cause it's something that you did
Is it something in my mind
I don't know what it is
That's got me, so beautifully blind
And it feels like love
It feels like love
And it won't be enough
But it feels like
Like you might be the death of me
You might be the death of me
Give me something to believe
You might be the death of me
And it feels like love
It feels like love
And it won't be enough
But it feels like
Like you might be the death of me
You might be the death of me
Give me something to believe
You might be the death of me
